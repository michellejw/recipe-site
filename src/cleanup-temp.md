# Files to Remove

Since we've redesigned the modal system and removed the browse tab, these files are no longer needed:

1. SearchFilter.tsx - was only used in the browse tab
2. MissingIngredients.tsx - marked as no longer needed
3. MissingIngredientsModal.tsx - replaced by RecipeIngredientsModal.tsx

The app now has a cleaner architecture with just:
- PantryView (with built-in recipe search by ingredients)
- ShoppingListView 
- RecipeIngredientsModal (comprehensive ingredient management)
